## Image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation
The main objective of this project to develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation which can perform operations like  swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel and also allow users to encrypt and decrypt their images.
### About the project
This project is a Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. The core functionality relies on XOR operations to securely alter the pixel values of an image, making it unreadable without the correct key. The tool allows users to input an image, apply encryption, and later decrypt the image using the same key.This program uses the Pillow library for image processing.
### Features
- Encryption: Securely encrypts image files by manipulating pixel values using a randomly generated key.
- Decryption: Recovers the original image from the encrypted file using the same key.
- Custom Output Paths: Allows users to specify where the encrypted and decrypted images are saved.
- Simple Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for seamless encryption and decryption.
